# UCLA_EE3_Project_Car
This project is the final project of UCLA's EE3 (Introduction to Electrical Engineering) class in Fall 2020. My partner was Ramtin Sharafoleslami. 

## Description
The main goal of this project is to implement code for a path-following car using RSLK. The car should be able to follow a predetermined black curved path, turn 180ยบ around when it reaches the end of the path, and move back to the starting point and stop moving completely. Bonus credit was offered to students whose project car completed the above requirement within 11 seconds. For more information about the project, please read the Final Report. 

### Note
* To run the code on Energia, make sure to include "ECE.zip" to your library.
* A self-calibration step is required before every run
* My car passed the Race Day requirements
* My car passed the extra credit requirement 
* My Final Report received a score of 88/100
* Due to academic honesty reasons, please do not use or copy my code and report if you are currently enrolled in EE3
