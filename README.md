# UCLA_EE3_Project_Car
This project is the final project of UCLA's EE3 (Introduction to Electrical Engineering) class in Fall 2020.

## Description
The goal of this project is to implement code for a path following car. The path is given by the professor of this class, Dr. Briggs, and is a curved black path on a white background. Using the eight phototransistors on the project car, the car was able to determine if it is moving above the black path or not. With those readings, the wheels of the project car adjust their speeds accordingly. 

I added a self-calibration step before the car starts to move. When the power of the car is turned on, it is required to move the car vertically across the black path.

For more information about the project, please read the Final Report. 

### Note
* My car passed the Race Day requirements
* My Final Report received a score of 88/100
* Due to academic honesty reasons, please do not use or copy my code and report if you are currently enrolled in EE3
